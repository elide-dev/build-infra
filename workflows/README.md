## elide ci: workflows

This directory defines workflows which can be re-used across Elide codebases. Workflow or build "profiles" are stored within each subdirectory
underneath this one. Within each profile, one or more workflow definitions reside.

Typically, workflows are dispatched via the `workflow_call` mechanism, with structured inputs and outputs.
