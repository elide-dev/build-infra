## Gradle Convention Samples

These subprojects test out the [Gradle plugins](../plugins), [catalogs](../catalogs), [platforms](../platforms), and
other supplemental [libraries](../libs) which make up the `build-infra` project.

They are useful as reference for how to use the plugins, and serve as live tests which build with the rest of the
codebase.

### Available Samples

The following sample projects are available:

- **[`jmod-kotlin`](./jmod-kotlin)**: Kotlin/JVM project which builds a [`jmod`][0] output
- **[`jmod-library`](./jmod-library)**: Pure-Java project which builds a [`jmod`][0] output
